This directory contains a VERY minimalistic user inferface:

   - ui_cmd: tests most of the functions, developer use only
   - ui_cmd_listen: wait for messages from ceof
   - ui_cmd_peer_send: send message to a peer
   - ui_cmd_quit: tell ceof and all EOFs to quit

You are encouraged to write your own, better user interface,
using the functions found in ../lib/.
