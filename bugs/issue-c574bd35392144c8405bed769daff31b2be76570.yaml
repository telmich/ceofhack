title: Add support for secret keys with password
desc: |-
  Normally gpg / pgp secret keys are password protected.
  
  Currently no part of ceof has support for this, which should be fixed ;-)
  
  Implementation:
  
  - add a passphrase callback function for gpgme
  - add a commands to eofi2ui:
  - eofi asks all connected uis to enter passphrase
  - ui sends passphrase to eofi
  - ui should provide a function to cache the passhprase
  - this will never be supported in ceof directly, because a new UI should
  not automatically have access to the secret key
