title: "Refactor: cmds_init() and friends"
desc: |-
  cmds_init() and all related functions are user interface functions!
  
  The react on "/<cmd>" and are entered by the user.
  
  As this data will later never be delivered to ceof directly AND
  it conflicts with the name of "cmd_handle" and friends, it should
  be renamed to ui_cmd_init() or moved to ui/cmd (where "cmd" now
  stands for "commandline").
