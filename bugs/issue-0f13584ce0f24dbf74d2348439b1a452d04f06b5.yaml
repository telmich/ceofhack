title: Implement report() function like the one found in gpm
desc: |-
  The gpm report function (http://unix.schottelius.org/gpm) is pretty smart:
  
  It has va_arg support and knows about different message levels (similar to
  syslog).
  
  The syslog part can be skipped, but ceof_report() should be exportable into
  a lib.
  
  It shoul also support prefixes like:
  
  ceof_report("gpg", int level, char *msg, ...);
  
  The possible prefixes should be defined in eof.h.
