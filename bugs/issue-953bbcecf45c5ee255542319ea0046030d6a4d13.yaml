title: Implement classes of helpers
desc: |-
  If a helper exits, this may be good or not.
  
  To be able to differentiate, implement classes (or categories, as you like ;-) to
  distinguish them:
  
  Add field to struct helper (class/cat(egory))
  Extend helper_* functions to request category.
  Extend signal_child() to do the right thing if something exited.
  
  Possible categories:
  
  * once: start once, be happy if it exited 0 (otherwise warn user)
  * once_failok: start once, be happy when the child is dead
  * respawn: restart, if it fails (for listening transport protocols)
  
  Also implement helper_cat_change() to be able to change category later
  (if listening transport protocol should be stopped for instance)
