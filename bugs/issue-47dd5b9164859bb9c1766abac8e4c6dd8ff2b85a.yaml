title: Define how to pass error messages from transport protocols
desc: |-
  Currently transport protcocols can write their diagnostics and stuff
  to stderr. As there's no real UI yet, this is not a problem *now*.
  
  But it looks ugly and we introduce bugs like {issue 5253867587e14132eb05ba6221e3c38726a07409} to differentiate between
  transport protocols.
  
  The real fix would be:
  
  - connect stderr of tp to ceof
  - expand helper, forkexecpipe to also read stderr
  - then print text prefixed by tp/<name>/<listen|send>:
