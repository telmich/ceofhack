title: Fork() for connections
desc: |-
  As we always read fixed length strings in blocking mode, any
  EOFs can block whole ceof.
  
  Thus we can only trust ourself. So for an incoming connection,
  create a fork() which gets all data and only passes it completly
  to ceof, if everything is fine.
