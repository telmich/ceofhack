title: Shutdown TPL on exit
desc: |-
  Currently we just leave behind the listening transport protocols, which
  is ugly and makes them fail to start the next time.
  
  Send exit command to TPL on exit,
  documentate & define in doc/EOF.tex,
  import into eof.h,
  implement into existing transport protocols.
