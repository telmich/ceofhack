title: Add support for debugging messages of TP in UI
desc: |-
  When the bug {issue 47dd5b9164859bb9c1766abac8e4c6dd8ff2b85a} is fixed, ceofhack knows about errors and where they come
  from.
  
  ceofhack should pass the debugging messages to the UI, which can decide
  whether to show it to the user or not.
  
  Todo:
  
  - create commands
  - define what an UI should be able to do with those messages, like:
  
  - hide per default
  - show errors on "debugging console"
  - or ...
