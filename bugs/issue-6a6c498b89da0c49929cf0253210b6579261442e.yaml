title: Add queue for outgoing packets
desc: |-
  Whenever we send an packet, it needs to stay in the queue until the peer
  acked that she received it.
  
  Status of a packet can be:
  
  * IN_TP: packet transmitted to TP
  * AT_PEER: TP transmitted it to the next peer
  * ACKNOWLEDGED: final peer received it
  
  This queue should later be splitted of ceof and migrated to the postbote.
