title: Check whether splittoff of MAX_COMM makes sense
desc: |-
  We're using MAX_COMM for helper and poll's fd list.
  Does it make sense to have bigger/smaller list or MUST both
  be same size?

    It does *NOT* make sense to use different limits: every helper needs to be
    poll()ed. The only difference is that helpers may exit and that there may be
    holes in the list of helpers, but not in the fd list, so being asynchron.
