Compile:
   $ make

Configure:
   $ ./scripts/init_home.sh

Usage:
   $ ./ceofhack
   /peer add <name> tcp://<ip>:<port> (use from user2ceof)
   /msg <peer> <msg>

Bugs:
   Many. This is just a hack.

   Your port is currently ignored.
   You cannot connect to somebody behind NAT.
   You need /usr/bin/gpg.
   You need $HOME.
