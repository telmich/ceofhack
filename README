   -- Nico Schottelius, 2008-06-23

Compile:
   $ make

Configure:
   $ ./scripts/init_home.sh

Bugs:
   Besides there are many and this is just a hack, you can lookup
   them using ditz (http://ditz.rubyforge.org/README.txt):

      ditz todo
      ditz status

   If you want to work on a bug, use "ditz help" to get
   familar with it.
