A very minimalistic EOF-2 implementation.

   -- Nico Schottelius, 2008-06-23

Compile:
   $ make

Configure:
   $ ./scripts/init_home.sh

Usage:
   $ ./ceofhack
   /peer add <name> tcp:<ip>:<port>
   /peer send <peer> <msg>

Bugs:
   Besides there are many and this is just a hack, you can lookup
   them using ditz (http://ditz.rubyforge.org/README.txt):

      ditz todo
      ditz status

   If you want to work on a bug, use "ditz help" to get
   familar with it.

   Your port is currently ignored.
   You cannot connect to somebody behind NAT.
   You need /usr/bin/gpg.
   You need $HOME.

Development:

   Have a look at doc/coding_style.
