\section{Abstract}
EOF is chat protocol that supports secure chatting.
Secure chatting consists of the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) know \emph{that} you wrote a message.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) can view the \emph{message content}.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) can \emph{verify} the source of the message being you.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) know \emph{who} you sent a message to.
\end{enumerate}
We don't think it's possible to hide that you are part of the chat network.
Thus, every participant of an EOF network will constantly send packets
(so called \emph{noise}) in a defined frequency (for instance every 250 ms).
The noise is also used to defend against timing analysis.
In case you are sending out a message, the message packet will be added to the
queue and sent with the next free interval.

We encrypt and sign every message via public-key cryptography\cite{pgp-1},
so that only the receiver can decrypt, view the message content and verify
the message sender.

The message packets are always send indirectly via onion routing\cite{onion-1}.
The idea is taken from the Tor project\cite{tor-1}, though EOF uses an enhanced
version: EOF does not know about entry or exit nodes. If you are the final
receiver you may or may not continue to forward the message.

EOF knows about two different chat destinations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Peers
\item Groups of peers
\end{enumerate}
groups = channel, irc rfc
