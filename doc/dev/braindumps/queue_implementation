Send packet XXXX, ID YYYY, channel ZZ.

Incoming packet on channel ZZ.
Read command XXXX, read ID YYYY.

Search for ID YYYY on queue for channel ZZ: which command was sent?
   Command XXX2 found.
      Does command XXXX and XXX2 match?
      Match means: Is XXX2 a possible answer for XXXX?
      Call apropriate handler for XXX2.
   No command found:
      XXXX must be initiating the conversation.
      Search apropriate handler for XXXX on channel ZZ.
      Save ID.
      

So befor passing to a handler, we read
EOF_L_Cmd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create general handler.

   Always read EOF_L_CMD + EOF_L_ID.

   1. Check whether this ID is already is known for this EOFs
      (IDs are always local to one EOFs)
   1.1 If it is known, check whether the commands fits.
   1.1.1 If it fits, continue.
   1.1.2 If not, tell that the EOFs
   1.1 If it is unknown, call the specific command

   Define a set a commands that are "initiating commands".
      -> no need to search for an ID.
         -> maybe still, to avoid conflicts.



   read_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If input comes from fd_x, which EOFs is it?
Has to be registered, when the fd is added to the helper system.

We read cmd, id from a fd.
/**** the idea

Get the queue/EOFs the fd is associated to.

   Table / Relation:

   EOFs        Initial commands (per EOFs)   Waiting commands

   LTP,        2100, ...                     2101
   TP,
   UI

If we get data on fd X, we search for a handler for this fd.
This handler already knows to which eofs it belongs.


NEXT:
   List of eofs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General command handling:
x List of all EOFs
x For each EOFs type define possible commands
x For all commands define the type (question/answer)
x Define the handler for the command

The queue:
- Needs to belong to a EOFs type
- Needs to store the ID of questions
- Needs to store the command number of the question
- Need one queue per EOFs (even for the same type of EOFs)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not possible to create a dynamic field in C as in:

   struct cmdnew eofs_list[EOF_EOFS_MAX][] = { 
      { /* EOF_EOFS_TPL */
         { EOF_CMD_TPS_SENT, EOF_CMD_ASR, cmd_2000, { cmd_20xx, cmd_21xx, NULL } },
      }   
   };  

Thus we need to stick to an array of linked lists!

Thus we can also stick to the current layout:
   - linked list of categories (= subsystems)
   - linked list of commands below categories

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category = Type of EOFs
Queue = An instance of an EOFs
   -> picture!
   queue has a fd(-array) assigned!

queue_new()
   - fd[] to operate on?
   - category the queue belongs to

queue_read()
   - has fd
   - has command
   - has id
   - handler for helper

queue_find_by_fd()
   - find correct queue by fd (to operate on)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make cmd_handle more intelligent:

   - read command
   - retrieve category
      - run category default command if unmatching
   - check if command needs entry in queue
