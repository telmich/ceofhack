Currently we do not support re-encryption to the next peer, which
would also included two onion shells. If there's for instance
this source route:


   A  -> B  -> [C]  -> D

A is the sender, C is the receiver.
The following happens at A:

- Create noise packet to be dropped for D ("pkgD")
- Create packet for C:
   - Add command "has data" for C
   - Add command "forward to D" for C
   - Add message for C
   - Add already created packet pkgD
   - Encrypt packet for C
- Create forward packet for B
   - Add command forward to C
   - Add already created packet pkgC
- Submit to a transport protocol, which sends it to B

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is, that with each host the packet gets smaller.
In practise, peers should re-encrypt the packet.
To be able to re-encrypt it, we must make sure
