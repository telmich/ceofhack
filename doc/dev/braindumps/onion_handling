- Send packet from ceofhack:

   - Create onion with n layers
   - All functions need to accept previously generated layers


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need functions, which realise the following push/pop (or add/del) methods:

forward()      - somewhere
msg_forward()  - somewhere
msg_drop()     - always the last in the chain?
drop()         - always the last in the chain?

We also need some random (noise!) input to decide, which packets to use
in which order.
