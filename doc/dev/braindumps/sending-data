tp_send.c
   how to handle send / trasport protocol?
      - pipe data to it, add pipe to handler array, leave function
      - when ack is replied, re-draw message?
         - would need to track outgoing packages
         - is needed for later versions anyway (think of resend)
      - create a queue of un-ack-ed packages?
         - not acked by transport protocol =>
            - same as not acked by next peer
         - not acked by final peer
            struct package {
               int id;        /* internal identifier        */
               int state;     /* NO_ACK, TP_ACK, FINAL_ACK  */
               char *dest;    /* who to send to             */
               char *msg;     /* plaintext message          */
            };
         - dest is the nick currently, but should be updated to a list later,
           to support groups:
            struct destination {
               struct peer *who;
               struct destination next;
            }
         - parse queue every $interval
            - to trigger resend
            - post-0.1 version
