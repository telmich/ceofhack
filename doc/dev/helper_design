Helper are used to create a uniform layout for handling input.


Each helper has

   * pid (possibly 0, if no child assosiated)
   * a fd for reading,
   * a fd for writing (may be the same)
   * a function that handles the input
   * an associated class

   "fd input to function"

For each fd there may be patterns, on which to call
a different set of functions.

   * type of pattern (int, char, float)
   * pattern (union)

unix input = libunixinput = libui -> -lui
