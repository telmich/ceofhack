Features:
- switch to the asynchronous gpgme functions
- allow other encryption methods (like ssh!)
- add support for more than one address for peer
- add support to save (autosave) peers and keys (cconfig)
- add support for cconfig-load (store cconfig directly into a structure)
- configure gpg-binary in .ceof
- implement topic for channels

Code:
- replace int[] for handler with int (check_input.c and dependend)
- create a struct array for commands (user_input.c)
- sanitise input (currently buffer overflow possible: peer_add.c)
- add function to delete cconfig_tree (cconfig_tree_burn.c)
