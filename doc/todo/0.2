Could also fit into 0.2, but would be nice for 0.1:

- create macros:
   - maybe reuse report.c from gpm (license is ok)

   - error(char *str, ...); 
   - warn(char *str, ...); 
   - info(char *str, ...); 
   - debug(char *str, ...);
   
   - which use the function report(int level, char *str, ...)
   - using __FILE__ and __LINE__ in output
   - error/warn print to stderr
   - info to stdout
   - debug only if debug=1 (command line switch or compile option)
   - currently no other differences, but framework for later
      - may use different prefixes

- replace all printf()s with macros
